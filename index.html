				<p id = "profile_paragraph"> <br>My name is Eric Shiple and I am a student at the University of Michigan. I am currently in my second year of studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering. I have spent most of my life in Lexington, Massachusetts, though I also lived in Grenoble, France for seven years. I enjoy spending my time playing pick-up sports (soccer, basketball, spikeball, you name it!), watching football games, and studying with my friends.</p>

					<li>Porter Builders</li>
					<li>May 2018 - August 2018</li>

					<li>Over the summer I worked as a materials runner and assistant to the contractor for <a href = "http://porterrenovations.com/" target="_blank">Porter Builders</a>, a construction company. Throughout the summer, I:
					<ul id = "keypoints">
						<li>Interacted with suppliers to procure and deliver the necessary materials to the job site when needed, allowing builders, painters, and carpenters to work uninterrupted </li>
						<li>Performed various tasks to keep the job site clean and organized, increasing productivity and company image</li>
					</ul>
					I am grateful for this experience because it taught me many lessons that can be applied in the future. I learned what it felt like to work 40 hours per week, how to communicate with superiors, co-workers, and suppliers, and how to optimize tasks to meet deadlines. I also had the opportunity to gain insight into the lives of my eight co-workers, all of whom were Guatemalan expatriates.
